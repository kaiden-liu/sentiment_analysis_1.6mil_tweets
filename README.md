# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets and Stock Market Performance

This repository contains the code and resources for the research paper titled "Sentiment Analysis of Tweets and Stock Market Performance". The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between the sentiment of tweets and the performance of the US stock market.

## Abstract
Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms where users share their thoughts and opinions. In this research paper, we utilize the BERT model and the Naive Bayes model to analyze the sentiment of tweets and observe if there is a correlation with the US stock market performance. We apply these models to the Sentiment140 dataset and compare the sentiment analysis results with the S&P500 market index. The findings show a weak positive correlation between tweet sentiments and the trend of the US stock market.

## Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the Sentiment140 dataset for sentiment analysis.
2. Model Training: Train the BERT model and the Naive Bayes model on the preprocessed data.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Apply the trained models to analyze the sentiment of tweets.
4. Data Analysis: Compare the sentiment analysis results with the S&P500 market index and calculate the correlation.
5. Results and Visualization: Generate visualizations and reports to present the findings.
6. Future Research: Discuss potential areas for future research in sentiment analysis and stock market prediction.
